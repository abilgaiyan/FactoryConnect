# GG-003 Stage-B persistence implementation contract

Baseline: `31aec8a71701b4c11aa49378582c321b54cc709b`, 18 October 2026.
Status: implementation started; durable containment publication is still unavailable.

## Authority and terminology

This implementation map records the authorization to start persistence. The
accepted RC2 specification remains a separately retained review reference; its
complete text and package are not redistributed in this branch. In particular,
the historical authority binding is mandatory in V2.

Roadmap B1 means production persistence, B2 means composition, B3 means restored
replay. The original RC2 document calls its design review B1 and its implementation
B2. References to those historical labels must not change the execution order.

PR #121 is merged in baseline history as `50138db`. Its schema/concurrency probes
remain design-validation evidence: their B1ValidationOnly JSON receipts are not
FCWE/FCDS and do not establish production publisher, decoder or read acceptance.
The accepted schema and concurrency checkpoints are retained. Production tests
must exercise the new materializers and validator rather than rerun the prototype
and claim it proves those implementations.

## Fixed contract

| Area | Required implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Policy and routing | `availability-scope-containment/1`; exact processor from `AvailabilityContainmentV1.ProjectionProcessorId`; independent checkpoint; all outcomes under this policy use format 2 |
| Legacy | Preserve historical SQL/checksums, FCEK V1, FCDS V1 bytes, reason vocabulary and default composition; never reinterpret old results |
| Witness | FCWE V1, complete fact and both aggregates, exact historical cut, normalized operand names, deterministic lowest offending position |
| Result | Recursive FCDS V2 with mandatory policy and per-node historical authority binding; fixed built-in 1.0 unpartitioned shift/day definitions |
| Identity | Three distinct zero-terminated digest domains from RC2 section 5; exact full bytes compared after hash matches |
| Slot | Projection processor + exact FCEK bytes + source revision; changed content conflicts even if ResultId changes |
| SQL | RC2 archives, complete CHECK/FK/trigger definitions; no CASCADE; no archive backfill from legacy rows |
| Atomicity | Witness/result/reference/retained projection/evidence/manifest/checkpoint share one existing publication transaction |
| Replay | Identical current replay verifies history and all bound content with zero writes; conflicts roll back; older checkpoint replay remains rejected |
| Read | Existing stable read discipline; exact processor and bound receipt; verify canonical bytes, semantic binding and historical authority before returning any page |
| Errors | Missing authority, stored integrity failure and unsupported version remain distinct; no fallback processor/revision or ordinary metric reason substitution |

## Production implementation sequence

| Slice | Concrete source work | Acceptance gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 — canonical formats | FCWE V1 and FCDS V2 encoders/strict bounded decoders, historical-binding model, identity and reference-path codecs | Seven accepted RC2 envelope vectors and all three domains byte-for-byte; six existing negatives plus allocation/depth/Unicode/order/semantic forgeries; unchanged V1 golden bytes |
| P2 — schema authority | Forward migration after current 020, explicit 12-command execution on one connection/transaction, catalog and startup/physical-schema descriptors | Fresh creation, 020 upgrade, rollback, rerun, actual constraints/triggers, preserved 001–020 checksums and populated V1 replay |
| P3 — historical validator | Transaction-aware contribution, completed transition/cut, outcome and standard readers; deterministic independent snapshot/evaluation reconstruction | Uses caller's connection/transaction throughout; exact A/R/S and source membership; missing authority differs from contradiction; later contributions excluded |
| P4 — publication | Format-aware processor registration and commit validation, preflight, archive slots/identities/references and retained publisher; complete replay comparison | Actual production paths satisfy atomic rollback, identical replay, changed-slot rejection, shared witnesses and source-writer/read interleavings |
| P5 — reads and API | V1/V2 dispatch, verified query/detail/summary materialization, per-metric metadata and controlled evidence errors; regenerate OpenAPI/client contract | Exact-processor isolation; whole-page failure; null metadata for synthesized missing cells; all three routes and Daily/Range failure composition |

P1 now includes FCWE V1 and FCDS V2 encoders/decoders, historical-binding claims,
bounded digest and NodePath primitives, and executable comparisons with all seven
accepted envelope vectors. The private review document, reference calculators
and complete package are not redistributed. The test resource contains the
required sanitized vector inputs/bytes/digests and negatives only, plus a V1
regression specimen. See [P1 implementation and validation](GG003-stage-b-p1-codecs.md).
P1 review/CI acceptance does not complete persistence or enable publication.

P1 at `8208ad6b` passed both CI jobs. P2 now registers migration 021 and its
twelve-command execution plan with physical schema authority and upgrade/rollback
tests; see [P2 schema implementation](GG003-stage-b-p2-schema.md). P2 SQL acceptance passed at `5f830ed7`: both `build-and-test` and
`sql-server-integration` completed successfully after the legacy snapshot
comparison was updated to account for migration-021 defaulted columns.
P3 contribution, Availability, Performance R/S and recursive result validators are
accepted/frozen at `d5f55651` after 60 focused SQL cases and both CI jobs passed
(run `39156354487`: 780 SQL passed, one restored test skipped). P4/P5 and
production-path integration remain pending. The publication guard is intact.

Migration 021 is registered with twelve command boundaries and caller-owned
transaction semantics. The schema prototype established why one combined DDL
command is not sufficient. Preserve the registered migration's checked-in
checksum, execution boundaries and physical-schema validation during P3–P5.

## Publication and historical validation

Preflight encodes and checks the complete batch without mutation. Inside the
existing Serializable publication transaction preserve processor → checkpoint →
projection → manifest → evidence acquisition. Acquire result-slot ranges, then
witness keys, result IDs and reference prefixes in the RC2 deterministic order.
Validate historical authority using that same transaction before any mutation.
Account for implicit source locks acquired by FKs, as the accepted traces do.

Aggregation cut A includes incorporated contributions only. Availability,
Utilization and Quality use their specified direct operands. Performance also
requires the exact completed transition for A, its terminal R, the `(A,R)` cut,
the complete produced-source set and the selected outcome/standard revisions S.
The current public historical reader opens additional connections and cannot be
used unchanged as this validator. A pending transition is not verified missing
reference time. OEE validates all children even when Availability is unavailable.
The separate assumed-quality and derived provisional OEE stores cannot be
substituted into these fixed built-in definitions.

Compare full canonical/index content and the complete reference set for every
existing slot/digest before writes. Insert immutable archives only for a new
publication, update the retained set through its normal coordinator, then advance
the checkpoint and commit once. Replaying cannot repair missing archive rows.
Independent reads perform the same authority checks; a hash is never membership
proof. No source history mutation is needed for this work.

## API boundary

RC2 section 17 governs the existing three reporting query routes. Per metric,
add explicit `publicationFormatVersion`, `evaluationPolicyId`, `resultId` and
`conflictWitnessId`. A nested Availability witness does not become an OEE root
witness. Unknown codec → 501; recognized malformed evidence → 500; canonical
evidence lacking required historical authority → 503. Keep existing 400/409
contracts distinct and do not catch arbitrary SQL/runtime errors as authority
failures. Verification failure rejects the whole page and new report composition.

## Completion and subsequent work

Persistence is complete only after P1–P5 pass on the reviewed head through actual
production paths, including the SQL suite. Until then retain Stage A's publication
guard and keep containment composition disabled. The original RC2 guard can be
replaced only with complete format/schema/processor validation, never simply
removed to permit tests or replay.

Composition then selects the separate containment processor explicitly. The
subsequent disposable GG-003 restore acceptance must publish actual revision 534
with Availability `Unavailable / RunningOutsidePlannedProduction`, null value,
the exact position-380 witness and original operands, plus nested OEE evidence.
Verify atomic checkpoint advancement, restart, idempotence, conflict rejection,
immutable historical receipts after later advancement and exact API retrieval.
The 34-contribution fixture is not a complete factory-ledger replay.

This branch does not perform a restore, move a checkpoint, alter factory
configuration or activate a release. Equipment Performance can continue as its
own customer-facing slice; full report acceptance remains separate from this
persistence work.

## Validation of the foundation slice

- Added ordinary .NET tests for three independent digest probes, envelope bounds,
  exact NodePath bytes, malformed lengths/counts and maximum depth.
- No local .NET SDK is installed; no local .NET/SQL pass is claimed.
- CI results must be recorded against the actual PR head before merge.

These original foundation results are historical. Subsequent P1 implementation
and local SDK/test evidence are recorded in the linked P1 document.

## P3 start gate — 18 October 2026

P2 acceptance permits implementation of the historical authority validator,
**not** activation of containment publication. P3 must:

1. Accept the caller's open SQL connection and active transaction. Never open a
   second connection or start/commit an independent transaction for authority reads.
2. Bind the exact aggregation processor, input stream and revision A; reconstruct
   only incorporated contributions at or before A. Reject absent, duplicate,
   conflicting and out-of-cut membership rather than relying on an envelope hash.
3. Recompute both complete Availability aggregates and the deterministic first
   offending RunningDuration contribution; verify its complete fact, scope and
   original position, not just its witness ID.
4. For Performance, require the completed transition and exact terminal R,
   complete `(A,R)` source cut, produced-source set and selected outcome/standard
   revisions S. Pending reference-time transitions are not verified missing data.
5. Validate every FCDS V2 dependency recursively, including OEE children whose
   Availability result is Unavailable. Distinguish missing authority from
   contradictory/corrupt authority and unsupported codec versions.
6. Cover stable historical cuts, later-source exclusions, changed contributions,
   incomplete transitions, missing outcomes/standards, forged but canonical
   witness/result envelopes and concurrency with source writers. Verify zero
   writes by P3 itself.

Acceptance evidence must exercise the production SQL reader/validator seam with
real SQL transactions; a mock-only test or the 34-contribution historical fixture
is insufficient. Keep the Stage-A publication guard and separate processor
registration unchanged until P4 and composition are explicitly accepted.

## P3 implementation ledger

- `ff9a8f3d`: added `SqlContainmentHistoricalContributionReader`, a production
  SQL reader taking the caller's `SqlConnection` and `SqlTransaction`.
  It checks the exact processor/stream/revision binding and enumerates admitted
  contribution facts at or before that cut in stable position order, retaining
  original fact and period-ownership fields. No independent connection,
  transaction or write is opened by this reader.
- At `ff9a8f3d`, this was only a source-membership primitive. The following
  Availability slice adds aggregate/witness reconstruction and SQL tests. R/S and
  recursive result verification are added in the follow-up below. Do not wire
  this seam to publication or reporting reads before P3–P5 acceptance.

### P3 contribution and Availability implementation

The reader now returns complete `PositionedMetricInputFact` instances using the
existing historical fact materializer, including every domain fact field and
both period identities. It resolves the logical processor and stream from the
claimed cut, requires its exact revision, and reads only incorporated membership
through A with the composite fact/stream/position join. Broken joins and duplicate
membership are rejected. It requires the caller's open Serializable transaction;
no equivalent isolation modes are currently admitted.

`MissingContainmentHistoricalAuthorityException` distinguishes absent processor
or revision authority from `ContainmentHistoricalIntegrityException` for binding,
materialization, membership, aggregate or witness contradictions. SQL errors and
cancellation are not translated into authority errors.

`SqlContainmentAvailabilityAuthorityValidator` independently rebuilds both fixed
Availability operands from these SQL contributions. The existing deterministic
Core builder validates duration/eligibility semantics and selects the lowest
position. Verification compares complete canonical FCWE bytes against the
reconstructed witness, including all fact fields, period, cut, aggregate counts
and timestamp bounds. This seam verifies Availability witnesses only; it does
not validate an FCDS result or certify a missing Performance operand.

Eleven new real SQL cases cover full fact equality, raw unincorporated facts
inside A, later incorporated facts, shift/day aggregates, canonical forgeries,
missing/corrupt authority, malformed values, cancellation, isolation/transaction
ownership, caller-visible updates and rollback, source-writer lock contention,
and zero mutations across source/projection/archive snapshots. The named CI
step retains a TRX artifact before the full SQL suite. SQL results remain pending
on the implementation head. At this initial slice, Performance R/S and recursive
verification were still pending; the follow-up below implements those seams.
No publication/read wiring,
guard change, migration change or factory activation is included.

Local validation for this Availability slice: all 759 ordinary Release Integration
tests passed; the integration project compiled successfully. No local SQL pass
is claimed; the new SQL cases require the dedicated CI gate.

The initial P3 CI attempt at `152730e9` (run `39150990424`) passed ten of
11 focused SQL cases. The remaining case failed before reconstruction because
the shared legacy fixture did not create the migration-021 archive tables needed
for mutation snapshots. The P3 fixture now creates a disposable current-schema
database through the actual migration engine; the snapshot assertions remain
intact. This correction does not change the production reader or validator.

### P3 Performance R/S and recursive result implementation

`SqlContainmentReferenceTimeAuthorityValidator` obtains incorporated sources from
SQL itself. It verifies every completed transition through exact A, its immediate
aggregation predecessor and starting/terminal R chain, each exact `(A,R)` cut,
and the complete produced-source outcome inventory for each delta. Pending or
absent transitions, missing cuts/outcomes and incomplete standard inventories
are missing-authority failures, never verified `MissingReferenceTime` outcomes.
Extraneous sources, mixed S, malformed or contradictory canonical outcomes are
integrity failures. Every selected outcome is independently resolved using the
complete historical production-standard cut S, including machine precedence,
effective intervals, unresolved statuses and ambiguity sets. Later A/R/S evidence
is excluded. The Performance binding records terminal R and the exact period's
sorted source IDs and distinct standard revisions. Empty or unresolved but fully
verified source sets yield the ordinary missing reference-time operand.

`SqlContainmentHistoricalResultValidator` re-evaluates the fixed built-in
unpartitioned definitions with a caller-transaction snapshot reader. It supplies
independently reconstructed direct operands, Availability witnesses and verified
reference time to the existing Core evaluator, which evaluates every OEE child.
It then compares the complete canonical FCDS V2 bytes, including recursive child
results and every historical binding. An unavailable Availability factor cannot
hide a forged Quality child or missing Performance authority. Unknown codec
versions, recognized integrity failures, missing authority, SQL failures and
cancellation remain distinct. No claim can supply its own source-fact inventory.

Existing source/materializer helpers have internal visibility for reuse; their
legacy query behavior is unchanged. No migration, publication guard, processor
registration, coordinator, composition, API or factory configuration is changed.
The new validators do not open connections or own/commit/roll back transactions.

26 additional SQL cases exercise resolved shift/day results, unavailable OEE with
all dependencies retained, canonical unresolved/empty authority, later A/R/S
advancement, missing and pending transitions, missing outcomes/cuts/selected and
unselected standards, contradictory sources/outcomes/S, forged canonical result
bindings and later dependencies, codec errors, source-writer locking, and zero
mutations. The dedicated retained P3 TRX gate now includes these and the earlier
11 Availability cases (37 total), followed by the full SQL suite.

Local SDK 10.0.402: all 759 ordinary Release Integration tests pass. The new SQL
cases have not run locally because the local engine is unavailable. SQL CI and
independent acceptance remain pending on this implementation head. CI monitoring
is handed back to the user as requested. P4/P5 must exercise these production
seams inside actual publication/replay and stable read transactions; P3 acceptance
does not itself complete durable reporting or unblock GG-003 restored replay.

### P3 targeted acceptance validation

The core implementation at `28bf2cf5` passed CI run `39153712128`:
37/37 focused P3 cases and 757 full SQL cases passed; the restored GG-003 test
was skipped. Both CI jobs passed on that exact head. This validates the core
implementation but does not establish restored recovery or P4/P5 integration.

The follow-up adds 23 SQL cases without changing production code:

- Eight direct Utilization shift/day cases cover calculated values, missing
  numerator/denominator and zero denominator without requiring an R transition.
- Quantity cases cover produced-only, good/rejected/both siblings, zero quantity,
  orphan good/rejected facts, duplicated/fractional/unidentified produced sources
  and inconsistent sibling attribution. Good/rejected evidence alone cannot
  establish produced-source authority; siblings never multiply produced count.
- Multi-shift sources across completed revisions verify shift-specific source
  inventories, a combined day inventory, complete terminal R and exact values.
- Real claim-bound outcome admission and convergence completion run while a
  Serializable validator transaction has observed the pending transition.
  Admission cannot make the result verifiable; completion is observed waiting
  on the reader's lock and becomes visible only after caller rollback.
- Real aggregation advancement and standard publication run concurrently with
  historical verification. Tests observe either a committed writer operation or
  a SQL DMV lock wait before re-verifying the old canonical envelope. Both valid
  schedules preserve exact historical A/R/S; no assumption that an out-of-cut
  writer must block is imposed. The new A remains unverifiable until actual
  convergence completes. Probe deadlines and writer cancellation are bounded;
  SQL wait-state observations replace timing-only synchronization.

The retained P3 gate now contains 60 cases. Existing cases keep their original
seed defaults; fixture options add the targeted shapes and pending-transition
setup. No additional migrations, public APIs, production hooks, guard changes,
publication, reporting or factory activation are included. P3 remains OPEN until
this targeted SQL gate and the full suite pass and receive acceptance review.
P4 atomic publication follows that gate; restored replay remains after P4/P5.
CI monitoring remains with the user; no new SQL pass is claimed locally.

### P4 first slice — immutable archive transaction foundation

P4 is OPEN and incomplete. The current legacy commit contract intentionally
rejects containment projections. That guard remains intact. This slice builds
the archive substep needed by the future format-aware coordinator; it does not
provide a standalone production publisher or enable processor composition.

`ContainmentArchiveBatch` freezes incoming buffers, decodes canonical FCDS V2,
requires one exact processor/A and distinct evaluation keys, and prepares all
result/key/witness identities plus complete root/nested witness reference paths.
`SqlContainmentArchiveTransaction.PrepareAsync` requires an existing format-2
processor with the exact policy and aggregation/stream binding, plus the caller's
open Serializable connection/transaction. It acquires the processor gate and
result slots, witness keys, result IDs and reference prefixes in deterministic
order. The eventual publication coordinator must own the existing retained
processor/checkpoint/projection/manifest/evidence prefix before this archive
substep; that integration is not implemented here.

Existing slots are compared using complete canonical bytes and indexed fields,
never a digest alone. Replay requires complete witness/reference content and
cannot repair missing rows. Every incoming result passes the P3 SQL validator
in the same transaction before archive DML. Witness fact row IDs are resolved
from the exact incorporated source ledger after archive lock acquisition. Shared
root/nested witnesses are deduplicated. The caller owns rollback and commit;
returned archive receipts are not durable-publication certificates.

16 SQL cases cover complete root/nested archive content, shared witnesses,
identical zero-write replay, malformed/duplicate input, a forged result later in
a batch, changed-slot conflicts, missing/corrupt references and archive indexes,
format rejection, caller isolation, cancellation, three failure boundaries,
caller rollback and concurrent identical preparations. The SQL fixture registers
a format-2 processor explicitly for archive tests; this is not production
registration or activation. A dedicated retained P4 TRX gate precedes the full
SQL regression suite. Local SQL execution is unavailable; CI results are pending
and monitoring is handed back to the user.

Remaining P4 work: production format-aware registration and commit preflight;
integration with the existing retained-row/evidence/manifest publication
coordinator; exact checkpoint/manifest replay and older-revision rejection;
complete archive-plus-retained-plus-checkpoint atomic rollback/replay tests and
source-writer/read interleavings through that production path. P5 verified API
reads, composition and disposable GG-003 replay remain later gates. No migration,
legacy V1 behavior, public commit guard or Gajra configuration is changed here.

### P4 continuation — internal atomic format-2 publisher (SQL acceptance pending)

`SqlContainmentPublicationTransaction.PublishAsync` now owns registration,
Serializable transaction, complete archive/retained publication, checkpoint,
commit and rollback. This supersedes the remaining integration work listed for
its archive-only predecessor above. It is an internal, uncomposed seam: neither
the public guarded commit constructor nor the running projection worker routes
containment work through it. No factory configuration or migration is changed.

Incoming envelopes are frozen and canonically decoded before SQL work. Every
incoming result is independently verified by P3 before archive insertion. The
publisher renders retained identities, values and component/FCDS V2 dependency
evidence from those claims only within this verified transaction; it does not
manufacture a verified Core witness from decoded bytes.

The writer order is exclusive processor application gate, registration slot,
checkpoint slot, complete retained projection hash prefix, manifest, evidence
in row-id order, existing retained archives, incoming archive slots and their
witness/result/reference locks, historical authority, then publication DML and
checkpoint. Existing retained archives are traversed in projection hash order;
each archive helper retains its deterministic internal order. The gate remains
held through commit/rollback, including replay. All format-2 publisher and archive
helper callers acquire that same gate; stable readers use its shared mode.
No source writer is assumed to participate in that application gate: historical
source stability is supplied by Serializable P3 reads.

Before archive DML, every existing retained row is compared against its full
canonical archive, including all structured keys, order keys, scalar values,
format/policy, result/witness bindings and evidence fields. Existing immutable
archive content/references and P3 authority are reverified, including unchanged
older retained rows. The latest manifest must exactly equal rows at the current
checkpoint, and the latest result-archive inventory must match that manifest.
Advancement also checks the caller's complete expected manifest. An independently
committed archive-only revision (including witness-only preparation) is rejected,
not completed or repaired by the publisher.

Same-revision replay requires exact incoming retained rows, complete evidence and
manifest membership, and performs no DML. Backward publication and stale expected
checkpoints are rejected. Advancement preserves unaffected retained rows and old
immutable archives, replaces affected evidence, writes the exact latest manifest
and moves the checkpoint in one transaction. Final retained/evidence/manifest/
checkpoint state is re-read before commit. Cancellation and any injected failure
roll back registration, archives, retained changes and checkpoint together.

The new SQL suite covers all eleven failure stages for initial publication,
retained replay corruption, checkpoint cancellation, concurrent identical and
manifest-conflicting publishers, shared-gate reader blocking, historical source
writer contention, archive-only/format-1 rejection, and seven advancement failure
boundaries with unchanged-row retention and backward-replay rejection. A named
`p4-atomic-publication-evidence` artifact retains its TRX independently of the
archive foundation artifact. SQL execution is unavailable locally; these are
implemented tests, not a claim of passing SQL evidence. CI monitoring remains
with the user.

P4 remains OPEN pending real SQL results and review. Revalidating P3 for all
retained rows favors correctness in this internal slice; its cost is not yet a
factory-scale performance claim. P5 exact-processor verified reads and API work,
composition, and restored GG-003 replay remain subsequent gates. The public
publication guard, draft PR status and Gajra installation remain unchanged.

### P4 acceptance record — internal atomic publisher

The reviewed head `240890615a8bf7cbc5e3995f7e988038a0641cef` completed
[CI run 39160594558](https://github.com/abilgaiyan/FactoryConnect/actions/runs/39160594558)
with both jobs successful. The SQL logs confirm 60 focused P3, 16 archive and
31 atomic publication cases passed. The full SQL suite passed 827 tests, zero
failed, with one restored-database test skipped. This satisfies the outstanding
full-workflow gate for the provisionally accepted internal P4 implementation.
P4 is accepted at that head within its reviewed internal boundary; this does not
accept factory-scale performance or establish GG-003 recovery/activation.

### P5 implementation — verified exact-processor reporting reads

`SqlContainmentVerifiedRead` dispatches by the exact registered processor's
format/policy and validates the complete retained publication in the same reader
transaction. Missing exact processors remain absent; verification failures never
select a legacy or other machine processor. Existing format-1 materializers and
FCDS V1 codecs remain unchanged. A schema metadata probe preserves supported
legacy test/read surfaces that predate migration 021.

The canonical containment identity selects Serializable isolation in the shared
stable-read wrapper. This is an isolation choice, not proof: the reader still
checks persisted format, policy, source, canonical identities and historical
membership. Legacy identities retain the prior ReadCommitted stable-read path.
Direct transaction-aware containment reads require caller-owned Serializable
transactions and use shared processor gates. Archive verification gains an
explicit existing-only, read-only mode: shared gate, shared/range locks, complete
archive index/content/reference and P3 checks, and an early return before every
archive insertion path. No archive receipt is treated as publication permission.

Read validation covers checkpoint/manifest membership, latest archive inventory,
retained structured/scalar/result/witness bindings, all component evidence, FCDS
V2 dependency bytes/hash/version, immutable witnesses and recursive references.
P3 independently reconstructs the result at each row's own historical cut. The
reconstruction seam now also returns the Core-built projection with its original
verified witness; decoding FCWE never fabricates Core authority. Existing P3
canonical result reconstruction delegates to that same computation, preserving
its comparison contract.

Detail, period summaries, checkpoint manifests, report windows and the existing
shift/production-day HTTP query endpoints share this verified path for format 2.
No HTTP contract or new route is introduced: unavailable/null values and
RunningOutsidePlannedProduction remain explicit in the existing response.
Integrity/authority failures propagate; the API returns failure rather than
partial/successful metric data. Details retain verified recursive witness proof
in the existing projection abstraction. Pagination/filtering remains above the
verified provider; summaries cannot bypass evidence validation.

New SQL cases exercise direct details/summaries/checkpoints, all five built-ins
for shift/day, legacy coexistence, exact absence, retained old/new cuts, missing
or incorrect policy, retained/archive/witness/reference corruption, distinct
missing historical authority, simultaneous readers/no-write behavior, actual
reader/publication blocking with cancellation, and shift/day HTTP success and
failure through the real SQL provider. A dedicated p5-verified-read-evidence TRX
artifact is retained before full regression. SQL execution is unavailable locally;
these tests await CI and independent review. P5 remains OPEN.

This implementation deliberately revalidates the retained processor snapshot,
even for a filtered request, and currently repeats reconstruction when producing
the Core projection after archive validation. This favors correctness and is not
a performance acceptance claim. Composition, public guard removal, restored
GG-003 worker replay and deployment are subsequent gates. PR remains draft;
Gajra and the running factory configuration are unchanged.

Local validation for this P5 tree: Release build and all 759 ordinary Integration
tests passed; discovery confirms 23 focused P5 SQL cases. No local SQL result is
claimed. CI monitoring is handed back to the user after pushing this slice.

### P5 HTTP follow-up — status taxonomy and publication provenance

The user-supplied focused log for `5792e021` establishes 21/23 SQL passes and two
HTTP success assertion failures. Both requests returned 200 with five metrics;
the tests searched for the display label `Availability` instead of the canonical
key `availability`. The assertions now use `CanonicalMetricKeys.Availability`.
This is not recorded as a green P5 gate or as successful full SQL regression.

The follow-up completes the reviewed HTTP implementation boundary:

- Provider-neutral `IOperationalMetricReportingReadFailure` classifies only
  explicit evidence exceptions. SQL's existing exception types retain their
  inheritance/identity and implement that interface. The API maps unsupported
  codec to 501 (`unsupported-reporting-codec`), absent historical authority to
  503 (`reporting-authority-unavailable`), and integrity failure to 500
  (`reporting-evidence-integrity`). Problem bodies contain stable codes/types
  without internal SQL/evidence details. Arbitrary SQL/runtime exceptions and
  cancellation are not reclassified. Existing 400/409 handling remains intact.
- Verified retained reads attach immutable publication provenance after their
  complete canonical/authority checks. It flows through projection, summary,
  query item and grouped report item into all three HTTP query responses.
  `publicationFormatVersion`, `evaluationPolicyId`, `resultId` and
  `conflictWitnessId` are explicit per-metric fields. Format-1 SQL rows report
  version 1 and null containment fields; synthesized summaries have null
  provenance. Core containment evaluation without durable publication has no
  publication receipt. Provenance alone never grants historical authority.
- Format-2 IDs are canonical uppercase 64-character hexadecimal SHA-256 values.
  `conflictWitnessId` describes only the result root. An OEE root retains null
  even when its Availability dependency has a conflict witness. Canonical codecs,
  identity algorithms, SQL migration/checksums and the public guard are unchanged.
- All three routes advertise 500/501/503 in OpenAPI. The Dashboard TypeScript
  contract is regenerated from that schema; no new route or factory UI activation
  is introduced.

21 new ordinary HTTP cases verify classified failures, unclassified runtime
failure, sanitized whole-response errors, and legacy/containment/synthesized
metadata across all three routes. The focused SQL suite expands from 23 to 31
cases: its HTTP matrix now exercises success and 500/501/503 for shift,
production-day and roster-backed production-day-shift queries through the real
SQL provider. Success checks every metric's exact result and root-witness IDs,
including OEE's null root witness. Existing direct-read checks cover legacy
publication metadata alongside exact processor isolation.

Local Release build and 780 ordinary Integration tests passed. Dashboard type
checking, 415 tests and production build passed; OpenAPI/client regeneration
succeeded. SQL results for this new tree remain pending CI; monitoring stays with
the user. P5 remains OPEN. No restored replay, composition activation, merge,
publication guard removal, factory checkpoint correction or Gajra action is
included or authorized by this follow-up.
