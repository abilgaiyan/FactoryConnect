# Stage-B P2 — registered SQL containment schema

Status: implementation prepared for SQL CI and independent review in draft PR #125.
P1 head `8208ad6b` completed both CI jobs successfully in run `39141636528`.
P3–P5, composition, durable recovery and deployment remain pending.

## Registered contract

Migration `021_DurableOperationalMetricContainment` follows catalog head 020.
Its DDL is byte-identical to the reviewed RC2 test resource after renaming the
eleven execution delimiters. No SQL predicate, FK, key, trigger body or historical
migration is changed. A unit test compares the complete texts and freezes all
twenty original canonical checksums.

The production executor validates the complete twelve-command plan before any
SQL. Only migration 021's exact identity opts into the plan. Existing migrations
retain single-command execution, including migration 003's existing policy.
All twelve commands use the caller's connection/transaction sequentially; the
executor neither opens a connection nor begins, commits or rolls back a
transaction. The existing migration engine owns the single commit, ledger insert
and final schema validation. No GO or independent batch transaction is introduced.

The schema adds immutable witness, result and witness-reference archives plus
format/policy/result/witness bindings on the existing processor/projection tables.
Defaults preserve format 1, null policy and null archive references for existing
data and unchanged legacy publishers. No row is converted to a V2 assessment.
The complete evidence subtype expression is retained with codec membership 1/2.
SQL enforces the reviewed structural relationships; it does not validate payload
canonicality, complete reference sets or historical authority.

Post021 extends the physical schema descriptor and owned-object set. Current
schema comparison additionally checks all triggers on the three archives and the
two publication-format defaults, including trigger definition/enabled/instead-of/
replication state. This is necessary to reject disabled immutability protection or
changed legacy defaults at migration completion and runtime startup. Older schema
descriptors retain their original table/column/key/check definitions.

## Validation coverage

- Fresh creation and post-020 upgrade through the real engine, exact Current
  descriptor, ledger/checksum/timestamp preservation and identical rerun.
- Production executor failure injection at each of the twelve compilation batches,
  caller rollback to exact Post020 and subsequent successful engine retry.
- Caller rollback after all twelve successful commands and pre-cancelled execution.
- Runtime/migration rejection of disabled, dropped or replaced immutable triggers
  and missing/changed publication-format defaults.
- Existing RC2 CHECK/FK/trigger/slot and populated V1 upgrade/read/replay probes now
  run both their original prototype SQL and the registered production executor.
  Sentinel archive payloads remain SQL-shape probes, not canonical authority.
- Existing concurrency prototype uses an explicit isolated Post020 baseline before
  its unchanged proposed schema. It remains design evidence, not P4 publication.

The new named SQL CI step runs the registered migration tests before the retained
prototype/concurrency and full SQL suite. Updating current-catalog assertions to
21 does not alter historical migration expectations or frozen checksum values.

Local SDK 10.0.402 ordinary Integration run: **759 passed, zero failed/skipped**.
The local SQL engine could not start in this environment; no local SQL pass is
claimed. SQL CI results must be recorded on the reviewed head before P2 acceptance.

Publication guards, V1 codecs, projection stores, processor composition, API and
factory configuration remain unchanged. The schema does not unblock revision 534.
